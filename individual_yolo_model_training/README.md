**MODEL TRAINING**
This folder contains the bash and python scripts necessary for individually training and evaluating a model. In previous semesters, it was used to take one of the pareto optimal individuals when the evolutionary loop finished and then take it to a full 50 to 100 epochs. In addition, the base model from which the LLM evolved from should also be ran as a comparison. Honestly you only need to do it once and then use it to compare from there.

Note: There hasn't been any edits made yet to the paths, so before anything is ran or submitted, please edit the paths for your purposes.
