Q: How can the model's performance or efficiency be elevated by amalgamating elements from these two code snippet alternatives?

1. Retain original class names.
2. Format the code in Markdown.
3. Exclude setup/demonstration code.
4. Retain original tensor input/output sizes.
5. Provide full code.
6. Must function with default settings.
7. The script that will parse your output will only take the first block of code/yaml output. Put it into one code block.
8. Do not put the explanation into the code block.
9. If the input is in YAML format, keep all outputs in YAML formatting
