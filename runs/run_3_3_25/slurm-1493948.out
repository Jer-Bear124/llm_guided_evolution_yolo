As an AI researcher celebrated for your unusual yet ingenious approach, you have a history of presenting surprisingly effective solutions that often defy conventional wisdom. Your talent for crafting these inventive strategies has led you to this latest task:

Q: Could you implement some creative and sophisticated modifications to this piece of YAML configuration in order to drastically improve the model's functionality? Designing and integrating bespoke helper functions is part of this challenge!

The current YAML configuration:
```python
# darknet53 backbone
backbone:
  # [from, number, module, args]
  - [-1, 1, Conv, [32, 3, 1]] # 0
  - [-1, 1, Conv, [64, 3, 2]] # 1-P1/2
  - [-1, 1, Bottleneck, [64]]
  - [-1, 1, Conv, [128, 3, 2]] # 3-P2/4
  - [-1, 2, Bottleneck, [128]]
  - [-1, 1, Conv, [256, 3, 2]] # 5-P3/8
  - [-1, 8, Bottleneck, [256]]
  - [-1, 1, Conv, [512, 3, 2]] # 7-P4/16
  - [-1, 8, Bottleneck, [512]]
  - [-1, 1, Conv, [1024, 3, 2]] # 9-P5/32
  - [-1, 4, Bottleneck, [1024]] # 10 
```
1. Modify the Parameters, Backbone or the Head of YOLO detection model defined in Ultralytics YOLO.
2. Retrain the same YAML format.
3. Exclude setup/demonstration.
4. Retain original tensor input/output sizes.
5. Resulting YAML Configurations should have all the parts of Parameters, YOLO Backbone, and the YOLO Head.
6. Must function with default settings.

 about how we can modify the given YAML configuration to improve the model's functionality. We will introduce new layers and helper functions to make the architecture more sophisticated. Here are our proposed changes:

1. Addition of a spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) layer after the backbone to increase the receptive field and help detect larger objects.
2. Introduction of a feature pyramid network (FPN) to combine features from different levels of the backbone and enhance object detection at various scales.
3. Implementation of a path aggregation network (PAN) to refine low-level features and improve localization accuracy.
