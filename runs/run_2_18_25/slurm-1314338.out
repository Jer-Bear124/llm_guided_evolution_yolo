Lmod has detected the following error: The following module(s) are unknown:
"gcc/13.2.0"

Please check the spelling or version number. Also try "module spider ..."
It is also possible your cache file is out-of-date; it may help to try:
  $ module --ignore_cache load "gcc/13.2.0"

Also make sure that all modulefiles written in TCL start with the string

As an unconventional AI researcher, renowned for your blend of serendipity and perhaps hidden genius, you have a knack for astonishing your colleagues with unorthodox yet effective improvements to models. This unique skill has led to your latest assignment: 

Q: How can you apply significant and complex modifications to this YAML configuration to substantially elevate the model's performance? Creating needed helper functions is encouraged!

The current YAML configuration:
```python
# Parameters
nc: 80 # number of classes
depth_multiple: 1.0 # model depth multiple
width_multiple: 1.0 # layer channel multiple 
```
1. Modify the Parameters, Backbone or the Head of YOLO detection model defined in Ultralytics YOLO.
2. Retrain the same YAML format.
3. Exclude setup/demonstration.
4. Retain original tensor input/output sizes.
5. Resulting YAML Configurations should have all the parts of Parameters, YOLO Backbone, and the YOLO Head.
6. Must function with default settings.
