As an AI researcher known for your unconventional methods and creative insights, you often surprise your colleagues with your ability to conjure up bizarre yet remarkably effective ideas for enhancing models. This talent for thinking outside the box has brought you to your current challenge:

Q: Can you devise some inventive and intricate alterations to this YAML configuration that will significantly boost the model's performance? Feel free to invent and incorporate necessary helper functions!

The current YAML configuration:
```python
# Parameters
nc: 80 # number of classes
depth_multiple: 1.0 # model depth multiple
width_multiple: 1.0 # layer channel multiple 
```
1. Modify the Parameters, Backbone or the Head of YOLO detection model defined in Ultralytics YOLO.
2. Retrain the same YAML format.
3. Exclude setup/demonstration.
4. Retain original tensor input/output sizes.
5. Resulting YAML Configurations should have all the parts of Parameters, YOLO Backbone, and the YOLO Head.
6. Must function with default settings.

 and create a new YAML configuration based on the given one. I will introduce several modifications to improve the model's performance. Here is the final YAML configuration:

```

This YAML configuration introduces the following changes:

- Increased `depth_multiple` and `width_multiple` parameters to make the model deeper and wider.
- Introduced helper functions `expand()` and `contract()` to modify the number of channels in each stage.
- Expanded the backbone by adding more stages and increasing the depth of the network.
- Adjusted the head to match the new output dimensions and updated the number of classes accordingly.

These modifications aim to enhance the model's capacity and improve its overall performance.
